# A+ Complete!
## My Thoughts

CompTIA's A+ certification was not the most exciting cert, but I am glad I completed it. As someone wanting a career in IT and cybersecurity, 
I found the material to be important in building a solid foundation. The entire process of studying and passing both exams took me about 3-4 weeks, 
which I found to be a good pace to stay motivated and not forget any material. Here are the resources I used, starting with the most helpful: 
- [Professor Messor's 1101/1102 YouTube Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87t6P5ZHTP0&list=PLG49S3nxzAnnOmvg5UGVenB_qQgsh01uC&ab_channel=ProfessorMesser)
- [Professor Messor's A+ Exam Notes](https://www.professormesser.com/220-1101-success-bundle/)
- [Exam Compass Practice Exams](https://www.examcompass.com/comptia-a-plus-certification-practice-test-1-exam-220-1101)
- Misc. Exam Dumps on YouTube

I think anyone who is considering taking this exam and is not prohibited by the cost should do so! I am excited and proud to 
add it to my resume for the next 3+ years.
## What's Next?

At the time of writing this, I am studying for Network+ and plan to take the exam at the end of this month (April 2025). 
I am finding the material interesting and easy to stay motivated while studying after work. I hope to put out a similar blog post in about a month! <br>
