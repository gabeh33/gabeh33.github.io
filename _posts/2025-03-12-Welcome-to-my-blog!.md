# Welcome to my blog!
## Thanks for stopping by, let me introduce myself


My name is Gabe, I am a cyberseucity graduate from Northeastern University currently working in IT at a small MSP near Boston. I love learning and am always trying to get better at what I do. 




## Why this blog?
There are a few goals and reason I want to start putting my thoughts on the interet
- Track different projects I work on
- Talk about topics in security I find interesting 
- Learn new skills (web dev!!)
- Expand on my resume for any prospective employers
- See my progress throughout my career

The blog itself is hosted through github pages, credit to [Chad's Blog](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html) for a great tutorial on how to get started, and [Dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io/) for the open source Markdown editor I will be using. That's all for now, I will be posting about my current projects in the next few weeks!
